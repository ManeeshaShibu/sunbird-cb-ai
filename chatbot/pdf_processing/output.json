[{"page_num": 0, "text": "Mahatma Gandhi\n\nMohandas  Karamchand  Gandhi[pron  1]  (2  October  1869  \u2013  30  January\n1948)  was  an  Indian  lawyer,  anti-colonial  nationalist  and  political  ethicist\nwho  employed  nonviolent  resistance  to  lead  the  successful  campaign  for\nIndia's  independence  from  British  rule.  He  inspired  movements  for  civil\nrights  and  freedom  across  the  world.  The  honorific  Mah\u0101tm\u0101  (from\nSanskrit  'great-souled,  venerable'),  first  applied  to  him  in  South Africa  in\n1914, is now used throughout the world.\n\nBorn and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the\nlaw  at  the  Inner  Temple,  London,  and  was  called  to  the  bar  at  age  22  in\nJune 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start\na successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an\nIndian  merchant  in  a  lawsuit.  He  went  on  to  live  in  South Africa  for  21\nyears. It was here that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent\nresistance  in  a  campaign  for  civil  rights.  In  1915,  aged  45,  he  returned  to\nIndia and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers\nto protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.\n\nAssuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led\nnationwide  campaigns  for  easing  poverty,  expanding  women's  rights,\nbuilding  religious  and  ethnic  amity,  ending  untouchability,  and,  above  all,\nachieving  swaraj  or  self-rule.  Gandhi  adopted  the  short  dhoti  woven  with\nhand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began\nto  live  in  a  self-sufficient  residential  community,  to  eat  simple  food,  and\nundertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest.\nBringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them\nin challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi\nSalt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He\nwas  imprisoned  many  times  and  for  many  years  in  both  South Africa  and\nIndia.\n\nBorn\n\nDied\n\nGandhi's  vision  of  an  independent  India  based  on  religious  pluralism  was\nchallenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a\nseparate  homeland  for  Muslims  within  British  India.  In  August  1947,\nBritain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned\ninto  two  dominions,  a  Hindu-majority  India  and  a  Muslim-majority\nPakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and  Sikhs made their way\nto  their  new  lands,  religious  violence  broke  out,  especially  in  the  Punjab\nand  Bengal.  Abstaining  from  the  official  celebration  of  independence,\nGandhi  visited  the  affected  areas,  attempting  to  alleviate  distress.  In  the\nmonths following, he undertook several hunger strikes to stop the religious\nviolence. The last of these was begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948 when he\nwas 78. The belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defense of both\nPakistan and Indian Muslims spread among some Hindus in India. Among\nthese was Nathuram Godse, a militant Hindu nationalist from Pune, western\nIndia,  who  assassinated  Gandhi  by  firing  three  bullets  into  his  chest  at  an\ninterfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948.\n\nMah\u0101tm\u0101\nGandhi\n\nGandhi in 1931\n\nMohandas\nKaramchand Gandhi\n2 October 1869\nPorbandar,\nPorbandar State,\n\nKathiawar Agency,\nBritish India\n(present-day\nGujarat, India)\n\n30 January 1948\n(aged 78)\nNew Delhi, Dominion\nof India\n\nCause of\n\nAssassination\n\ndeath\n\n(gunshot wounds)\n\nMonuments\n\nRaj Ghat\n\nOther names\n\nCitizenship\n\nAlma mater\n\nGandhi Smriti\n\nBapu, Father of the\nNation\n\nBritish Empire\n(1869\u20131947)\n\nDominion of India\n(1947\u20131948)\n\nSamaldas Arts\nCollege[a]\n\n\f", "header": null, "footer": null, "is_outline": false}, {"page_num": 1, "text": "Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti,\na national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence.\nGandhi is considered to be the Father of the Nation in post-colonial India.\nDuring  India's  nationalist  movement  and  in  several  decades  immediately\nafter, he was also commonly called Bapu (Gujarati endearment for \"father\",\nroughly \"papa\",[2] \"daddy\"[3]).\n\nEarly life and background\n\nParents\n\nGandhi's father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885), served as\nthe  dewan  (chief  minister)  of  Porbandar  state.[4][5]  His  family  originated\nfrom  the  then  village  of  Kutiana  in  what  was  then  Junagadh  State.[6]\nAlthough  he  only  had  been  a  clerk  in  the  state  administration  and  had  an\nelementary education, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister.[7]\n\nDuring his tenure, Karamchand married four times. His first two wives died\nyoung, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was\nchildless.  In  1857,  he  sought  his  third  wife's  permission  to  remarry;  that\nyear,  he  married  Putlibai  (1844\u20131891),  who  also  came  from  Junagadh,[7]\nand was from a Pranami Vaishnava family.[8] Karamchand and Putlibai had\nfour  children:  a  son,  Laxmidas  (c. 1860\u20131914);  a  daughter,  Raliatbehn\n(1862\u20131960);  a  second  son,  Karsandas  (c. 1866\u20131913).[9][10]  and  a  third\nson,  Mohandas  Karamchand  Gandhi[11][12]  who  was  born  on  2  October\n1869[13] in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the\nKathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar\nin the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj.\n\nIn 1874, Gandhi's father Karamchand left Porbandar for the smaller state of\nRajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib; though\nRajkot  was  a  less  prestigious  state  than  Porbandar,  the  British  regional\npolitical agency was located there, which gave the state's diwan a measure\nof  security.[14]  In  1876,  Karamchand  became  diwan  of  Rajkot  and  was\nsucceeded as diwan of Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas. His family then\nrejoined him in Rajkot.[15]\n\nChildhood\n\nAs  a  child,  Gandhi  was  described  by  his  sister  Raliat  as  \"restless  as\nmercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was\ntwisting  dogs'  ears.\"[16]  The  Indian  classics,  especially  the  stories  of\nShravana  and  king  Harishchandra,  had  a  great  impact  on  Gandhi  in  his\nchildhood.  In  his  autobiography,  he  states  that  they  left  an  indelible\nimpression  on  his  mind.  He  writes:  \"It  haunted  me  and  I  must  have  acted\nHarishchandra  to  myself  times  without  number.\"  Gandhi's  early  self-\nidentification  with  truth  and  love  as  supreme  values  is  traceable  to  these\nepic characters.[17][18]\n\nThe family's religious background was eclectic. Mohandas was born into a\nGujarati  Hindu  Modh  Bania  family.[19][20]  Gandhi's  father  Karamchand\nwas  Hindu  and  his  mother  Putlibai  was  from  a  Pranami  Vaishnava  Hindu\nfamily.[21][22]  Gandhi's  father  was  of  Modh  Baniya  caste  in  the  varna  of\nVaishya.[23]  His  mother  came  from  the  medieval  Krishna  bhakti-based\n\nUniversity College\nLondon[b]\nInns of Court School\nof Law\n\nOccupations\n\nLawyer \u00b7 anti-\n\ncolonialist \u00b7 political\nethicist\n\nYears active\n\n1893\u20131948\n\nEra\n\nBritish Raj\n\nKnown for\n\nLeadership of the\ncampaign for\nIndia's\nindependence\nfrom British rule\n\nNonviolent\n\nresistance\n\nNotable work The Story of My\nExperiments with\nTruth\n\nPolitical party Indian National\n\nCongress (1920\u2013\n1934)\n\nMovement\n\nIndian independence\n\nSpouse\n\nChildren\n\nParents\n\nRelatives\n\nAwards\n\nmovement\n\nKasturba Gandhi\n(m. 1883; died 1944)\n\nHarilal \u00b7 Manilal \u00b7\nRamdas \u00b7 Devdas\n\nKaramchand Gandhi\n(father)\n\nPutlibai Gandhi\n(mother)\n\nSee Family of\nMahatma Gandhi\nC.

There,\nhe  studied  the  rudiments  of  arithmetic,  history,  the  Gujarati  language  and\ngeography.[15]  At  the  age  of  11,  he  joined  the  High  School  in  Rajkot,\nAlfred High School.[27] He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a\nshy and tongue tied student, with no interest in games; his only companions were\nbooks and school lessons.[28]\n\nMarriage\n\nIn  May  1883,  the  13-year-old  Mohandas  was  married  to  14-year-old  Kasturbai\nGokuldas  Kapadia  (her  first  name  was  usually  shortened  to  \"Kasturba\",  and\naffectionately  to  \"Ba\")  in  an  arranged  marriage,  according  to  the  custom  of  the\nregion at that time.[29] In the process, he lost a year at school but was later allowed\nto make up by accelerating his studies.[30] His wedding was a joint event, where\nhis brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, he\nonce said, \"As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing\nnew  clothes,  eating  sweets  and  playing  with  relatives.\"  As  was  the  prevailing\ntradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and\naway from her husband.[31]\n\nGandhi (right) with his eldest\nbrother Laxmidas in 1886[26]\n\nWriting  many  years  later,  Mohandas  described  with  regret  the  lustful  feelings  he  felt  for  his  young  bride:  \"even  at\nschool I used to think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me.\" He later\nrecalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when she would visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being\nsexually lustful in his feelings for her.[32]\n\nIn late 1885, Gandhi's father Karamchand died.[33] Gandhi, then 16 years old, and his wife of age 17 had their first\nbaby,  who  survived  only  a  few  days.  The  two  deaths  anguished  Gandhi.[33]  The  Gandhi  couple  had  four  more\nchildren, all sons: Harilal, born in 1888; Manilal, born in 1892; Ramdas, born in 1897; and Devdas, born in 1900.[29]\n\nIn  November  1887,  the  18-year-old  Gandhi  graduated  from  high  school  in  Ahmedabad.[34]  In  January  1888,  he\nenrolled at Samaldas College in Bhavnagar State, then the sole degree-granting institution of higher education in the\nregion. However, he dropped out, and returned to his family in Porbandar.[35]\n\nThree years in London\n\nStudent of law\n\nGandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in Bombay.[36] Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest\nand family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London.[37][38] In July 1888,\nhis  wife  Kasturba  gave  birth  to  their  first  surviving  son,  Harilal.[39]  His  mother  was  not  comfortable  about  Gandhi\nleaving his wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew.\nGandhi  wanted  to  go.  To  persuade  his  wife  and  mother,  Gandhi  made  a  vow  in  front  of  his  mother  that  he  would\nabstain  from  meat,  alcohol  and  women.  Gandhi's  brother  Laxmidas,  who  was  already  a  lawyer,  cheered  Gandhi's\nLondon studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.[35][40]\n\n0:000:00/ 0:00/ 0:00\f", "header": null, "footer": null, "is_outline": false}, {"page_num": 3, "text": "On 10 August 1888, Gandhi aged 18, left Porbandar\nfor Mumbai, then known as Bombay. Upon arrival,\nhe  stayed  with  the  local  Modh  Bania  community\nwhose elders warned him that England would tempt\nhim to compromise his religion, and eat and drink in\nWestern  ways.  Despite  Gandhi  informing  them  of\nhis promise to his mother and her blessings, he was\nexcommunicated  from  his  caste.  Gandhi  ignored\nthis, and on 4 September, he sailed from Bombay to\nLondon,  with  his  brother  seeing  him  off.[39][36]\nGandhi attended University College, London, where\nhe  took  classes  in  English  literature  with  Henry\nMorley in 1888\u20131889.[41]\n\nCommemorative plaque at\n20 Baron's Court Road,\nBarons Court, London\n\nHe also enrolled at the Inns of Court School of Law\nin  Inner  Temple  with  the  intention  of  becoming  a\nbarrister.[38]  His  childhood  shyness  and  self-\nwithdrawal had continued through his teens. He retained these traits when he arrived in London, but joined a public\nspeaking practice group and overcame his shyness sufficiently to practise law.[42]\n\nGandhi in London as a law\nstudent\n\nHe  demonstrated  a  keen  interest  in  the  welfare  of  London's  impoverished  dockland  communities.  In  1889,  a  bitter\ntrade  dispute  broke  out  in  London,  with  dockers  striking  for  better  pay  and  conditions,  and  seamen,  shipbuilders,\nfactory  girls  and  other  joining  the  strike  in  solidarity.  The  strikers  were  successful,  in  part  due  to  the  mediation  of\nCardinal Manning, leading Gandhi and an Indian friend to make a point of visiting the cardinal and thanking him for\nhis work.[43]\n\nVegetarianism and committee work\n\nGandhi's time in London was influenced by the vow he had made to his mother. He tried to adopt \"English\" customs,\nincluding taking dancing lessons. However, he did not appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady\nand  was  frequently  hungry  until  he  found  one  of  London's  few  vegetarian  restaurants.  Influenced  by  Henry  Salt's\nwriting, he joined the London Vegetarian Society, and was elected to its executive committee[44] under the aegis of its\npresident and benefactor Arnold Hills. An achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a Bayswater\nchapter.[45] Some of the vegetarians he met were members of the Theosophical Society, which had been founded in\n1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of Buddhist and Hindu literature. They\nencouraged Gandhi to join them in reading the Bhagavad Gita both in translation as well as in the original.[44]\n\nGandhi had a friendly and productive relationship with Hills, but the two men took a different view on the continued\nLVS membership of fellow committee member Thomas Allinson. Their disagreement is the first known example of\nGandhi challenging authority, despite his shyness and temperamental disinclination towards confrontation.\n\nAllinson  had  been  promoting  newly  available  birth  control  methods,  but  Hills  disapproved  of  these,  believing  they\nundermined public morality. He believed vegetarianism to be a moral movement and that Allinson should therefore no\nlonger  remain  a  member  of  the  LVS.  Gandhi  shared  Hills'  views  on  the  dangers  of  birth  control,  but  defended\nAllinson's right to differ.[46] It would have been hard for Gandhi to challenge Hills; Hills was 12 years his senior and\nunlike  Gandhi,  highly  eloquent.  He  bankrolled  the  LVS  and  was  a  captain  of  industry  with  his  Thames  Ironworks\ncompany  employing  more  than  6,000  people  in  the  East  End  of  London.  He  was  also  a  highly  accomplished\nsportsman who later founded the football club West Ham United. In his 1927 An Autobiography, Vol. I, Gandhi wrote:\n\nThe question deeply interested me...I had a high regard for Mr. Hills and his generosity. But I thought it\nwas  quite  improper  to  exclude  a  man  from  a  vegetarian  society  simply  because  he  refused  to  regard\npuritan morals as one of the objects of the society[46]\n\n\f", "header": null, "footer": null, "is_outline": false}, {"page_num": 4, "text": "A motion to remove Allinson was raised, and was debated and voted on by the committee. Gandhi's shyness was an\nobstacle  to  his  defence  of  Allinson  at  the  committee  meeting.  He  wrote  his  views  down  on  paper  but  shyness\nprevented him from reading out his arguments, so Hills, the President, asked another committee member to read them\nout  for  him. Although  some  other  members  of  the  committee  agreed  with  Gandhi,  the  vote  was  lost  and Allinson\nexcluded.  There  were  no  hard  feelings,  with  Hills  proposing  the  toast  at  the  LVS  farewell  dinner  in  honour  of\nGandhi's return to India.[47]\n\nCalled to the bar\n\nGandhi, at age 22, was called to the bar in June 1891 and then left London for India, where he learned that his mother\nhad died while he was in London and that his family had kept the news from him.[44] His attempts at establishing a\nlaw  practice  in  Bombay  failed  because  he  was  psychologically  unable  to  cross-examine  witnesses.  He  returned  to\nRajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, but he was forced to stop when he ran afoul of British\nofficer Sam Sunny.[45][44]\n\nIn  1893,  a  Muslim  merchant  in  Kathiawar  named  Dada  Abdullah  contacted  Gandhi.  Abdullah  owned  a  large\nsuccessful shipping business in South Africa. His distant cousin in Johannesburg needed a lawyer, and they preferred\nsomeone with Kathiawari heritage. Gandhi inquired about his pay for the work. They offered a total salary of \u00a3105\n(~$4,143.31  2023  money)  plus  travel  expenses.  He  accepted  it,  knowing  that  it  would  be  at  least  a  one-year\ncommitment in the Colony of Natal, South Africa, also a part of the British Empire.[45][48]\n\nCivil rights activist in South Africa (1893\u20131914)\n\nIn April 1893, Gandhi aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for\nAbdullah's  cousin.[48][49]  He  spent  21  years  in  South  Africa,  where  he\ndeveloped his political views, ethics and politics.[50][51]\n\nImmediately  upon  arriving  in  South  Africa,  Gandhi  faced  discrimination\nbecause  of  his  skin  colour  and  heritage.[52]  He  was  not  allowed  to  sit  with\nEuropean  passengers  in  the  stagecoach  and  told  to  sit  on  the  floor  near  the\ndriver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for\ndaring  to  walk  near  a  house,  in  another  instance  thrown  off  a  train  at\nPietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class.[36][53] He sat in the train\nstation, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest\nfor his rights.[53] He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the\nnext  day.[54]  In  another  incident,  the  magistrate  of  a  Durban  court  ordered\nGandhi  to  remove  his  turban,  which  he  refused  to  do.[36]  Indians  were  not\nallowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a\npolice officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.[36]\n\nWhen  Gandhi  arrived  in  South Africa,  according  to  Herman,  he  thought  of\nhimself as \"a Briton first, and an Indian second\".[55] However, the prejudice\nagainst  him  and  his  fellow  Indians  from  British  people  that  Gandhi\nexperienced  and  observed  deeply  bothered  him.  He  found  it  humiliating,\nstruggling  to  understand  how  some  people  can  feel  honour  or  superiority  or\npleasure  in  such  inhumane  practices.[53]  Gandhi  began  to  question  his\npeople's standing in the British Empire.[56]\n\nBronze statue of Gandhi\ncommemorating the centenary of the\nincident at the Pietermaritzburg\nRailway Station, unveiled by\nArchbishop Desmond Tutu on\nChurch Street, Pietermaritzburg, in\nJune 1993\n\nThe Abdullah case that had brought him to South Africa concluded in May 1894, and the Indian community organised\na farewell party for Gandhi as he prepared to return to India.[57] However, a new Natal government discriminatory\nproposal led to Gandhi extending his original period of stay in South Africa. He planned to assist Indians in opposing\na  bill  to  deny  them  the  right  to  vote,  a  right  then  proposed  to  be  an  exclusive  European  right.  He  asked  Joseph\nChamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill.[50] Though unable to halt the bill's\npassage,  his  campaign  was  successful  in  drawing  attention  to  the  grievances  of  Indians  in  South Africa.
